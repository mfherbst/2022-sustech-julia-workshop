    "The aim of this notebook is to compute the value of $\\pi$ using a parallel Monte-Carlo implementation using thread-based parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows the classic approach to consider a circle of radius $1$ inscribed inside a unit square with side length $2$, running from $-1$ to $1$ in each axis. Since the area of the circle is $\\pi$, but the area of the square is $4$, a random \"dart\" thrown to the square will be inside the circle with probability $\\pi/4$. Therefore if we throw $N$ darts randomly, roughly $M = N \\pi/4$ will be inside the unit circle:"

    "5. Write a function `montecarlo_pi_nested(Ns::Vector{Int})`, which does the maximal parallelisation possible. Again benchmark this function and compare against your result from 4.\n",
