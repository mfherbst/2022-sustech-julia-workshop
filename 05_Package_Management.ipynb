    "\n",
    "Using external packages is simple and very wide-spread in Julia. You will almost always use external packages in your Julia code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result our project will feature **dependencies on other packages** and it can only be executed once those packages are present on teh executing machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This poses the usual problems of **compatibility** (packages will change over time!) and/or **availability** (packages that are no longer developed might stop working with newer Julia versions).\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that our code can be executed we need to guarantee that we have exactly the **exact same versions of the packages** that we had when writing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So **sharing the code is not enough** to ensure that someone else (colleague, reviewer, **ourselves in the future**) can run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia therefore provides a simple way to share both **code and snapshots of employed packages** in a package [environment](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#Environments-1).\n",

    "\n",
    "Next to managing dependencies on packages written in the Julia languages, the Julia registry also features support for tracking dependencies on **arbitrary data** including **compiled third-party code** in a platform-agnostic way (a bit like Conda).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [Julia Artifacts](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/artifacts/) system, arbitary data can be added to projects and packages. Based on this mechanism [JuliaBinaryWrappers](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers) provide an infrastructure for **versioned binary dependencies** in the form of special JLL packages. Beyond being a wrapper to automatically download matching binaries (for project, operating system, CPU etc.) JLL packages provide no further functionality. But this means by adding JLL packages to your project you can state and track binary dependencies as usual.\n",
